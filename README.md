# Dev Tool Dynamo

A small, fun, browser game to test your knowledge of the browser developer tools.

<http://thomasjbradley.github.com/dev-tool-dynamo/>

## Why

It was developed as a test for my students, to see if they have learned how to do perform simple tasks in the browser developer tools.

You should be able to complete the test in Firebug, Web Inspector or Dragonfly.
